Doesn't the sun shine anymore?
Doesn't the moon shine on the shore?
Doesn't the earth turn the same way?
For you, as it does for me, baby?

I doubt if it does to you
You don't know what I'm going through
I doubt if it does to you
You don't know what you put me through

Hasn't the rain stopped coming down?
Isn't the snow gone from the ground?
Doesn't it feel like a winter's day?
For us to be this way?

I doubt if it does to you
You don't know what I'm going through
I doubt if it does to you
You don't know what you put me through

Doesn't the sun shine anymore?
Doesn't the moon shine on the shore?
Doesn't the earth turn the same way?
For you, as it does for me, baby?

I doubt if it does to you
You don't know what I'm going through
I doubt if it does to you
You don't know what you put me through

I doubt if it does to you
You don't know what I'm going through
I doubt if it does to you
You don't know what you put me through

I doubt if it does to you
You don't know what I'm going through
